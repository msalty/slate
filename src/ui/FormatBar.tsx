/**
 * The formatting controls for Rich Text mode.
 *
 * One component, two presentations, the same as the context menu: a slim bar
 * under the editor head on a pointer device, and a bottom sheet on a phone,
 * where a toolbar of 14 small targets is unusable and the sheet is what the
 * platform's own notes app puts on screen.
 *
 * Every button reads its pressed state from `formatSnapshot`, which the editor
 * republishes on each selection change — so the bar always describes the text
 * the caret is actually in, rather than a mode the user has to remember.
 *
 * Both presentations are built from one list of groups, so a control is
 * described once and the bar and the sheet can never drift apart in what they
 * offer or what they call it.
